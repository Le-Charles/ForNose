# For Nose,
# If you don't already use SuperMacro, get the SuperMacro addon at https://github.com/Monteo/SuperMacro
# Put the SM_Extend.lua file in .../Addons/Interface/Supermacro or copy the contents into your existing SM_Extend.lua if you have one already.
# Reload UI if you're in game by typing "/script ReloadUI()" or log off and back on.
# Make a macro and with the text "/script NoseDance()"
# On the first press you should change to Berserker Stance, on the second press you should cast Recklessness, and on the third press it should go to Battle Stace.  I included a line to change back to battle stace if for some reason you cast recklessness but it gets dispeled or something but I'm not sure it's necessary.
# If you have any issues, send me an mail with what is wrong.  If you get error messages be sure to include the line number that the error message gives.
